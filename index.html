        <h1>Relay</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to our content-sharing platform! At Relay, you can access live videos and videos curated for your interests. You can also upload your own content. We want to make this experience enjoyable and engaging for you!
        </p>

        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>
            Relay is dedicated to making content creating and sharing easy for people of all skill levels. Our user-friendly website allows people to curate their own viewing experience and allows creators the freedom to post and stream the content they want. Our categories allow viewers to find content they are interested in, and our unique tagging system allows creators to expand their viewer base.
        </p>

        <h2>Why we do it</h2>
        <p>
            Relayâ€™s founders were frustrated with the shortcomings of other content platforms and created the platform of the future. We wanted to create a more welcoming community and make it easier for viewers to find content they love. We also wanted to create a platform that was better for creators and offered them more: more money, more viewers, and more exposure. Lastly, as content lovers ourselves, we wanted a platform that had minimal advertisements so that users could focus on the content. With these goals in mind, we created Relay.
        </p>

        <h2>Our platform</h2>
        <p>
            Relay offers a platform for many types of content, mainly videos and livestreams. We aim to make our profit through brand partnerships, donations, and minimal advertising. We do not want to take money from our creators, as they are the reason we are successful. Ultimately, we want a community of dedicated content-consumers that are eager to help us grow.
        </p>


        <h2>Creators</h2>
        <p>
            To get started with uploading content, please create an account with us. Once you have created an account, there will be links available to start a live stream or upload your own files. For live streams, you must input the video category before you go live. For all other content, once it has been uploaded, you will be able to select tags and add a description to your content. In addition to sharing your content, please fill out your account information. This will allow your viewers to support you and check out your other social media accounts.
        </p>

        <h2>Viewers</h2>
        <p>
            We have created several content categories to get you started. Click on the category you are most interested in, or use our convenient search bar to filter through the available content. On all content shared, creator information is available. Since Relay is a free platform, if you love content and are able to support creators, please help them by following their social media accounts and donating to their causes.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have any questions or concerns, please email us at <a href="mailto:relay1@gmail.com">relay1@gmail.com</a>. We appreciate all feedback on how to make this experience better for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enjoy and Relay!
